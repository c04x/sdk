# Ruyi OS

The operating system installed on the Ruyi console is a version of Windows 10 variably known as __Windows 10 IoT Enterprise__ or __Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB 2016__.  Note that this is not the same as [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot).

Essentially, it is Windows 10:

* Fixed to RS1 update (aka Redstone 1, Anniversary Update, version 1607)
* With security features of Windows 10 Enterprise (i.e. AppLocker and Device Guard)
* Without Microsoft Edge, Store, Cortana, and apps like Mail, Calendar, etc.

Together with our configuration and drivers it is __Ruyi OS__.
