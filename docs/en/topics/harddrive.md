Early Ruyi devkits shipped with a single Toshiba HDD.

Later Ruyi devkits shipped with a 128 GB SSD and 1 TB HDD.

## Maintenance

1. Make sure Ruyi is powered off, and flip it over
1. Slide switch in __Open__ direction

This exposes the two internal drive bays:

* The drive in the middle is the _primary_ drive and __must__ be present as Ruyi always boots from this drive.
* The other drive is the _secondary_ drive and is optional.

4. When finished, replace hard drive cover by gently pushing it back into place
