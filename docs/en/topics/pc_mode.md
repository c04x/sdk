# PC Mode

In addition to [Ruyi OS](os.md), Ruyi can be booted to a regular PC desktop.  This is referred to as "PC mode".

PC mode is similar to Ruyi OS- same version of Windows- but many of the security features have been turned off (Bitlocker, Device Guard Code Integrity, etc.).

![](/docs/img/warning.png) [BIOS](bios.md) updates should only be done from [Ruyi OS](os.md).  Make sure you are __not__ in [PC mode](pc_mode.md) before updating the BIOS.

## Switching

__As Administrator__ run SwitchOS.cmd (found on Windows Desktop).
