# C++ SDK Integration

This documentation is about how to intergrate Ruyi C++ SDK to a common VS C++ project.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) version 15.3 or later with the following individual components:
    - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.15063.0) (under __SDKs, libraries, and frameworks__)

## Download SDK from developer website Instructions

1. You can directly download our sdk from our developer website(http://dev.playruyi.com). Our SDK files will be in two folders: __include__ and __lib__.  
Put them in one of your source folder.  For example, create a "RuyiSDK" folder, then put them under it.

2. Right click your solution, click "Properties"

3. In Configuration Selection, choose "Release" "x64"

4. Choose "Configuration Properties / C/C++ / General" in Property Page, fill "$(ProjectDir)..\RuyiSDK\include" in "Additional Include Directories"

5. Choose "Configuration Properties / Linker / General" in Property Page, fill "$(ProjectDir)..\RuyiSDK\lib", "$(ProjectDir)..\RuyiSDK\lib\boost", "$(ProjectDir)..\RuyiSDK\lib\zmq" in "Additional Library Directiories"

6. Choose "Configuration Properties / Linker / Input" in Property page, fill "RuyiSDK.lib","libzmq.lib" in "Additional Dependencies"

7. #include "RuyiSDK.h" in your code, you can write as below:

    Ruyi::RuyiSDK* ruyiSDK = Ruyi::RuyiSDK::CreateSDKInstance(Ruyi::RuyiSDKContext(Ruyi::RuyiSDKContext::Endpoint::Console, "localhost"));

	if (nullptr != ruyiSDK)
	{
		std::string ret;
		
        ruyiSDK->BCService->Authentication_ClearSavedProfileID(0);
		ruyiSDK->BCService->Authentication_AuthenticateEmailPassword(ret, "username", "password", true, 0);

		std::cout << ret << std::endl;
	}

8 Compile the code, if everything goes well, which means you've intergrate Ruyi SDK successfully.
