# Unity 3D

We're planning to support [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/) as a first-class development environment for Ruyi.

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2017.1.1f1 (newer versions likely work)

## Quick Start

RuyiNet is provided as high-level wrapper around the Ruyi C# API.

1. [Download the UnityPackage version of the SDK](http://dev.playruyi.com/udownloadslist/SDK) and import the package into your project (Assets->Import Package->Custom Package...). 
1. Create an instance of RuyiNet script and add your app id/secret:
