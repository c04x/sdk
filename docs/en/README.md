## ![](/docs/img/warning.png) NOTICE
The Ruyi platform is still in an __early alpha__ state.  
You may experience one or more of the following:

* General brokenness
* Features haphazardly added/removed
* API/CLI/UI in constant flux
* Severely lacking, non-existent, or just plain misleading documentation
* Dubious spelling and/or grammar

In other words, __here be dragons__.
