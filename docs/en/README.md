# <img src="/img/warning.png" width="32" /> NOTICE
The Ruyi platform is still in an __early alpha__ state.
You may experience one or more of the following:

* General brokenness
* Features haphazardly added/removed
* API/CLI/UI in constant flux
* Severly lacking, non-existant, or just plain missleading documentation
* Dubious spelleng and/or grammar

In other words, here be dragons.
